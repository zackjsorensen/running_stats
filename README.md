**INTROCUCTION & GOALS**
This project is a database access system that can be used by High School Cross Country Coaches to find and analyze relevant race data.
The primary goal is to be able to enter information about an athlete, and receive reports of similar athletes with whom the entered athlete could compete, so coaches can tell their athletes who they should stick to.
This goal is my focus for my CS452 project, but I hope to do much more with this project, such as:
* Migrating it onto a web server/app
* Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms to identify trends and predict performance
* Analyze the progression of the sport using data science tools
* Create graphs that depict an athlete's progress
* Create race projections that show how each athlete is expected to place and the points they will score for the team
* Expand this to include Collegiate data
* Expand this to include Track and Field Data


**Initial ERD - keeping it simple to start:**

**TECHNOLOGIES**
* I am writing the datascraper application using python
* For the Database, I am using Supabase and PostgreSQL


**System Design**
* This is the design for what I hope to have after 20 hours of work, for my class project:

* And this is the long-term design:

**GOALS**
* Spend 2 hours per day minimum working on my project until the end of class
* Have a working command line interface that reports on teams, runners, and potential matchups of similar runners by the end of class
* Have a web server with extensive analytical features by the end of summer
